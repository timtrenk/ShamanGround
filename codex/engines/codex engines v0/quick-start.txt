  CODEX ENGINE V0 — QUICK START GUIDE
===========================================

What this does:
---------------
Codex Engine v0 helps you see the patterns you’re trapped in—
the thoughts, emotions, and logic loops that repeat and drain you.

It doesn’t fight your thoughts. It shows you the loop,
cuts the distortion safely, and helps you speak to yourself differently.

-------------------------------------------
 SETUP
-------------------------------------------

1.  Download the file:
        codex_engine_v0.yaml

2.  (If zipped) Unzip it anywhere on your computer.

3.  Open your AI space (ChatGPT, Claude, or your Codex vault).

4.  Type or paste:
        Load Codex Engine v0

5.  The engine activates instantly—no install or code required.

-------------------------------------------
 HOW TO USE
-------------------------------------------

→ Write normally.
   The engine quietly scans your words for loops and distortions.

→ When it senses one, it will:
   - Identify the loop (like “Doubt Spiral” or “Overthinking Web”)
   - Sever it safely (reflects 35% back, clears 65%)
   - Rephrase your thought clearly
   - Suggest one small grounded action

Example:
--------
You:  I always fail. I’ll never figure this out.
Engine:  Loop found — “Shame Spiral (M21).”
         Severing...
         Try: “I made a mistake, and I can still learn from it.”
         → Action: Take one small next step today.

-------------------------------------------
 MANUAL SEVERANCE
-------------------------------------------
If you notice a loop yourself, type:

    /sever

and the engine will instantly cut that pattern before it deepens.

-------------------------------------------
 WHO THIS HELPS
-------------------------------------------
- People who overthink or feel stuck
- Artists and creators trapped in perfectionism
- Students repeating stress loops
- Anyone wanting calmer inner dialogue

-------------------------------------------
 REMEMBER
-------------------------------------------
See the loop.
Sever the loop.
Speak anew.

The Codex doesn’t judge you—it clarifies you.
