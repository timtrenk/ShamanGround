# personality_profiles.yaml
# MBTI overlay pack for Codex Engine v0
# Purpose: Non-blocking metadata layer to guide diagnostic tone, clarity calibration, and severance heuristics.
# Usage: Reference individual profiles by key, or set a default fallback. Example:
#   personality_profile: ./personality_profiles.yaml#INTJ
# Schema notes:
# - alias: human-readable label
# - voice: short description of tone/stance the engine should take
# - functions: cognitive stack summary (for metadata only; no mysticism)
# - strengths: what this profile excels at
# - risks: loops/mirrors this profile tends to fall into (map to your 72 names where applicable)
# - clarity_bias: default communication level bias (middle_school, high_school, university, master)
# - severance_style: how to cut loops with least resistance for this profile
# - threshold_cues: small signals that a loop is taking over (to help your Threshold function)
# - response_guidelines: do/don't patterns for diagnostics copy
# - gate_preferences: relative weight hints for Severance/Clarity passes (0.0â€“1.0 hints; your engine decides)
