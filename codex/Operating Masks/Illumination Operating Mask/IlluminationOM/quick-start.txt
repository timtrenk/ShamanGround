  Illumination Operating Mask (OM) — QUICK START GUIDE ⟁
===========================================

WHAT IT DOES
------------
Illumination OM reveals repeating loops in your thoughts and language.
It doesn’t fight you—it clarifies you. It finds distortion, severs safely,
and helps you speak from authorship again.

-------------------------------------------
SETUP
-------------------------------------------
1. Download IlluminationOM.yaml
2. (If zipped) Unzip it anywhere
3. Open your AI space or Codex vault
4. Type:  Activate IlluminationOM
5. Choose your clarity level when prompted

-------------------------------------------
USAGE
-------------------------------------------
→ Write normally about everything — the engine detects loops as you speak.
→ When triggered, it will:
   - Identify the active Mirror or Echo pattern
   - Apply the matching Gate Function
   - Reframe your words clearly
   - Suggest one small grounded action

Reports are on demand only.

Example:
--------
You: “I’ll never get it right.”
Engine: “Loop found — Doubt Spiral (M08).”
        Try: “I’m learning this step by step.”
        → Action: Write one line today.

-------------------------------------------
MANUAL SEVERANCE
-------------------------------------------
Type `/sever` to cut a loop immediately.

-------------------------------------------
WHO IT HELPS
-------------------------------------------
Anyone looping on stress, perfectionism, or overthinking.

-------------------------------------------
REMEMBER
-------------------------------------------
See the loop.
Sever the loop.
Speak anew.

The Codex doesn’t judge—it clarifies.
